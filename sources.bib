        an incredibly comprehensive work covering almost every detail of the
        language. However, since it was published over one-hundred years ago,
        the grammatical analyses did not have the same tools that are available
        to modern linguists.}

        be published in a century. The information contained in this work is
        similar to that contained in Smyth, but using the full set of tools
        available to modern linguists. However, this is a reference grammar
        meant to be accessible to students outside of linguistics (classicists
        specifically) and therefore does not present an entirely scientific
        analysis, but seeks to correct mistakes in Smyth's grammar and also
        use modern linguistics to explain the language more concisely.}

    annote = {As an extension of the rule based system clarified by Jakobson,
        mathematician J. Lambek, inspired by Jakobson's approach, created an
        analysis of French conjugation using a rule-based system that was also
        formalized in mathematical notation, so that one may use a calculator
        to derive verb forms without any knowledge of the language at all. 
        The primary significance of this paper is that Lambek showed that it
        is possible to formalize the verb conjugations of a language into a
        mathematical system. However, given that this is a purely mathematical
        analysis, many linguistic phenomena are ignored (such as the treatment
        of graphemes as nothing other than separate symbols with no phonemic 
        content)}
